## SnowflakeOS

SnowflakeOS is a hobby OS I started in 2015 with the goal of learning about the inner workings of operating systems, and to program low-level stuff for the fun of it. I stopped working on it regularly shortly after starting the project as I no longer had the time.

### SnowflakeOS - Challenge Edition

This year, my school asked each student to choose a task to work on, a personal challenge, and freed up some time for them to work on it. I've chosen to resume work on SnowflakeOS, and work has begun!

#### Goals

The stated goals of development this year are the following:

- Displaying a basic user interface
- Being able to run a simple graphical program, such as a clock.
- Document my progress
- Create learning resources and improve existing ones

That makes only two technical goals, but they aren't the easy kind. Here is a non-exhaustive list of required features to complete those goals:

- Being able to run programs in usermode
- Task switching
- System calls from userspace
- Program loading
- 2D graphics library
- GUI toolkit

Note that I don't intend to have the best scheduler, the best GUI, or great performance: they will likely be terrible; but I want to have working versions of them, and to be able to show something working by June 2020.

### About this blog

I'm writing this blog to record my progress, but also hoping to share some of the cool things I come across in the world of OS development. If you learn anything reading one of my posts, that'd be awesome.  
However, I'm not an expert and I will surely make mistakes, which I'll try to correct as I go - at the very least I'll highlight them. If you spot any, please tell me!

I would love to get feedback, on anything! You'll find my email through my GitHub profile linked below.
