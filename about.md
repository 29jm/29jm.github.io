## SnowflakeOS

\> *"It is very special"*

SnowflakeOS is a hobby OS written in C for the x86 architecture. I started it in 2015 with the goal of learning about the inner workings of operating systems, and to program low-level stuff for the fun of it. It was on pause for a while, resumed, and will probably continue that cycle for a good long while.

### Goals

- Learning stuff,
- Explaining stuff,
- Keeping it running

Note that I don't intend to have the best scheduler, the best GUI, or great performance: they will likely be terrible; but I want to have working versions of them, and if possible, I want them to look cool.

### About this blog

I'm writing this blog to document my progress and share some of the cool things I come across in the world of OS development. If you learn anything reading one of my posts, that'd be awesome.  
However, I'm not an expert and I will surely make mistakes, which I'll try to correct as I go - at the very least I'll highlight them. If you spot any, please tell me!

### Contact me

I'd love to get feedback, on anything! You'll find my email through my GitHub profile linked below. I'm also on Keybase if you're into that.
