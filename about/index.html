<p>&gt; <em>“It is very special”</em></p>

<p>SnowflakeOS is a hobby OS written in C for the x86 architecture. I started it in 2015 with the goal of learning about the inner workings of operating systems, and to program low-level stuff for the fun of it. I had to stop working on it regularly shortly after starting the project as I no longer had the time.</p>

<h3 id="a-rebirth">A rebirth</h3>

<p>This year, my school asked each student to choose a task to work on, a personal challenge, and freed up some time for them to work on it. I’ve chosen to resume work on SnowflakeOS, and work has begun!</p>

<h4 id="goals">Goals</h4>

<p>The stated goals of development this year are the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Displaying a basic user interface: a desktop, a mouse</li>
  <li>Programs: a launcher, to start other programs, and at least a system monitor showing memory use and running programs</li>
  <li>Reasonable speed in QEMU: ~10 fps would be a start</li>
  <li>Document my progress</li>
  <li>Create learning resources and improve existing ones</li>
</ul>

<p>That makes only two technical goals, but they aren’t the easy kind. Here is a non-exhaustive list of required features to complete those goals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Being able to run programs in usermode</li>
  <li>Task switching</li>
  <li>System calls</li>
  <li>Program loading</li>
  <li>2D graphics library</li>
  <li>and many more</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that I don’t intend to have the best scheduler, the best GUI, or great performance: they will likely be terrible; but I want to have working versions of them, and to be able to show something working by June 2020.</p>

<h3 id="about-this-blog">About this blog</h3>

<p>I’m writing this blog to document my progress and share some of the cool things I come across in the world of OS development. If you learn anything reading one of my posts, that’d be awesome.<br />
However, I’m not an expert and I will surely make mistakes, which I’ll try to correct as I go - at the very least I’ll highlight them. If you spot any, please tell me!</p>

<h3 id="contact-me">Contact me</h3>

<p>I’d love to get feedback, on anything! You’ll find my email through my GitHub profile linked below. I’m also on Keybase if you’re into that.</p>
